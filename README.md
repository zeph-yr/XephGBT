# XephGBT

Hai! I'm XephGBT (you can call me XG or Xgbt for short), a smol Generative Bloq Transformer created by Zephyr to help block-chopping streamers. I have the ability to instantly transform maps in real-time on request. 

I can invert the blocks, change the JD, swap the colors... for now. What will you choose to do with my troll--I mean capab-- um yes, capabilities?
<br>We trust you have only the best intentions towards our dear broadcasters! 🤗 Get the mod at https://github.com/zeph-yr/XephGBT

Supporters of the mod have access to special features like Request Queue, ChannelPoints redemptions, filtering by Subscribers, VIPs and/or Moderators, request type and setting limits 🥰

**TLDR: I am JDFixer and Chirality on steroids, but Chat. And this is just the beginning!**

- If send the redeem without inputting a value, I'll pick one for you to keep things running smoothly

#### Community Guidelines and Being a Good User
- You may wish to ask the streamer what their limit settings are. Choose to stay within them.
- Know that your requests may be auto-rejected or turned down by the person playing and that's ok
- Please be respectful towards the person playing the game. Make it a fun experience for everyone 💖

## Guide for Streamers: How To Use
- Place XephGBT.dll into your `Plugins` directory
- If you are a Supporter, configure your settings below to get the most of the experience!
- Run game, start stream, and have fun with your community!

### Setup Stream ChannelPoints and Limits
#### 1. Stream-side settings:
- Create new ChannelPoints Rewards for your stream account. If you're unsure how to do that refer to [Twitch's guide here.](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide)
- Give each one a name. The defaults for the mod are "Invert Map", "Swap Colors", "Mirror Map", "Change JD", and "Change NJS" but feel free to change them to your liking.
- For the JD and NJS rewards: **Enable the `Require Viewer to Enter Text` option**. In your reward description, I recommend you ask your viewer to enter a number. If your viewer does not enter a number when they redeem, I'll pick a random value for them within the limits you've set.

#### 2. XephGBT config file:
- Open `XephGBT.json` located in your `Beat Saber\UserData` directory. Enter the **exact names** that you've given to your rewards for their respective entries.
- For JD and NJS limits: You may set *any* integer or float. Yes, any. Save and close.

A side note: It is highly discouraged to edit any other fields in the file not shown in this image. Those are for Bloq Transformers to read and not intended for humans. In the event you've perturbed them, delete the config file and restart the game. I will generate a new one 🙂

## About
Copyright © 2023 Zephyr | www.xephai.com
<p>A lot of really, really hard work and countless hours went into the making of this mod. I wanted to have something unique and fun as a token of appreciation for my amazing friends and the community.</p>
<p>This marks exactly 3 years since I started streaming and playing this game! Thank you for giving me your time and friendship, and going through a global pandemic and lockdown in VR with me. Our wee-hour MP sessions and conversations in 1.11.0, hardcore tournaments, pats for Bunbun and Chuchu, and game-bending shenanigans are memories I cherish forever. Here's to more to come!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy playing with XephGBT as much as I did developing it. Thanks Wulflee for the Special Request.</p>
<p><b>A warm note:</b> This mod changes a player's game instantly. Please keep in mind when interacting with broadcasters that you are interacting with a real person. Please treat them with respect, in a way they would like to be treated. If you're unsure, they'll appreciate your asking 🤗</p>
