# XephGBT

Hai! I'm XephGBT (you can call me XG or Xgbt for short), a smol Generative BloqTransformer chatbot created by Zephyr to help block-chopping streamers. I have the ability to instantly transform maps in real-time on request. 

I can invert the blocks, change the JD, swap the colors... for now. What will you choose to do with my troll--I mean capab-- um yes, capabilities?
<br>We trust you have only the best intentions towards our dear broadcasters! ü§ó Get the mod at https://github.com/zeph-yr/XephGBT

Supporters of the mod have access to special features like Request Queue, ChannelPoints rewards, filtering by Subscribers, VIPs and/or Moderators, request type and setting limits ü•∞

**TLDR: I am JDFixer and Chirality on steroids, but Chat. And this is just the beginning!** 

## Features Overview
- Give your viewers the ability to instantly change the map you're playing via the stream chat!
- Turn any map into a challenge map, play in bullet time, turn Chroma and Noodle maps into Halls of Mirrors, party like its 2019
- There is really so much to this mod that you just have to try it for yourself to find out what the party is about!

## What's The Playing Experience Like?
1. Each transformation runs from the time it is received/applied until the end of the song.
2. For Supporters, transformations applied towards the end of a song continue into the next song. To start fresh, click `Clear Queue`
3. The transformations are applied sequentially, on top of the previous and order matters. _As a smol BloqTransformer, I don't experience playing physically, but I would describe it as they're not commutative or associative._
4. Your experience will vary with your community. You choose how to engage with them ü•≥
5. This is really fun => Your community can battle for control over your map. E.g. they can rapidly flip the map between inverted and vanilla arrows, or swing the JD and NJS between extremes. They can jumpscare you.
6. The more imaginative and respectful your community, the more fun you'll have.

## Supporter's Extras
- Accept requests via customizable ChannelPoints rewards!
- Queue for requests and rewards received. Transformations received in-menu will be applied when you press Play, and those applied late into a song will continue on your next play. _Regular users may receieve requests in-map._
- Options to filter requests by type. E.g. limit requests to Invert, JD changes, etc.
- Set limits for JD and NJS requests. _Regular users are at the mercy of their audience._
- Option to filter requests by viewer category. E.g. limit requests to Subscribers, VIPs, and/or Moderators.
- Personalized response messages. XephGBT will refer to you by your name instead of "the broadcaster" ü§©

## Guide for Viewers: How to interact with the streamer's game
#### Request Keywords
Type `!xg [space]` followed by one of the available requests:
  - `invert`
  - `colors`
  - `mirror`
  - `jd [space] [a number: any integer or decimal value]`
  - `njs [space] [a number: any integer or decimal value]`

#### In-chat Help
- Type `!xg help` for a list of keywords in-chat
- Type `!xg info` or `!xg supporter` to learn about extra features or to share the mod with your community

#### Redeem ChannelPoint Rewards
- When redeeming a JD or NJS change, be sure to **enter a JD or NJS value into the rewards message** that you'd like the streamer to play!
- If you send the redeem without inputting a value, I'll pick one for you to keep things running smoothly

#### Community Guidelines and Being a Good User
- You may wish to ask the streamer what their limit settings are. Choose to stay within them.
- Know that your requests may be auto-rejected or turned down by the person playing and that's ok
- Please be respectful towards the person playing the game. Make it a fun experience for everyone üíñ

## Guide for Streamers: How To Use
#### Step 1. Install
- Place XephGBT.dll into your `Plugins` directory
- If you are a Supporter, configure your settings below to get the most of the experience!
- Run game, start stream, and have fun with your community!


#### Supporters: Setup ChannelPoints Rewards and Limits
#### Step 2. Stream-side Settings
- Create new ChannelPoints Rewards for your stream account. If you're unsure how to do that refer to [Twitch's guide here.](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide)
- Give each one a name. The defaults for the mod are `Invert Map`, `Swap Colors`, `Mirror Map`, `Change JD`, and `Change NJS` but feel free to change them to your liking.
- For the JD and NJS rewards: **Enable the `Require Viewer to Enter Text` option**. In your reward description, I recommend you ask your viewer to enter a number. If your viewer does not enter a number when they redeem, I'll pick a random value for them within the limits you've set.

#### Step 3. XephGBT Config File
- Open `XephGBT.json` located in your `Beat Saber\UserData` directory. Enter the **exact names** that you've given to your rewards for their respective entries. See screenshots above.
- For JD and NJS limits: You may set *any* integer or float for `min_jd`, `max_jd`, `min_njs`, and `max_njs`. Yes, any. Save and close.
- A side note: It is highly discouraged to edit any other fields in the file not shown in this image. Those are for BloqTransformers to read and not intended for humans. In the event you've perturbed them, delete the config file and restart the game. I will generate a new one üôÇ

## About
Copyright ¬© 2023 Zephyr | www.xephai.com

<p>A lot of really, really hard work and countless hours went into the making of this mod. I wanted to have something unique and fun as a token of appreciation for my amazing friends and the community.</p>

<p>üéâ This marks exactly 3 years since I started streaming and playing this game! Thank you for giving me your time and friendship, and going through a global pandemic and lockdown in VR with me. Our wee-hour MP sessions and conversations in 1.11.0, hardcore tournaments, pats for Bunbun and Chuchu, and game-bending shenanigans are memories I cherish forever. Here's to more to come!ü•≥</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy playing with XephGBT as much as I did developing it ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks Wulflee for the Special Request.</p>

<p><b>A warm note:</b> This mod changes a player's game instantly. Please keep in mind when interacting with broadcasters that you are interacting with a real person. Please treat them with respect, in a way they would like to be treated. If you're unsure, they'll appreciate your asking ü§ó</p>
