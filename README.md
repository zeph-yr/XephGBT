# XephGBT
Hai, I'm XephGBT (you can call me Xgbt for short), a Generative Bloq Transformer created by Zephyr. I instantly transform maps in real-time to troll --I mean "help", yes help-- my broadcaster to have fun with their lovely audiences like yourself!

TLDR: I am JDFixer and Chirality on steroids, but Chat. And this is just the beginning!

## Features
- Give your viewers the ability to instantly change the map you're playing via the stream chat!
- Turn any map into a challenge map, or play in bullet time
- There is really so much to this mod that you just have to try it for yourself to find out what the party is about!
- See this clip

## Supporter's Extras
- Accept requests via ChannelPoints!
- Options to filter requests by type. For example, limit requests to Invert, JD changes, etc.
- Customizable limits for JD and NJS requests
- Option to filter requests by viewer. For example, limit requests to Subscribers, VIPs, and/or Moderators
- Personalized response messages. XephGBT will refer to you by your name instead of "the broadcaster" :)

### ChannelPoint Redeems
- When redeeming a JD or NJS change, be sure to enter a value in the Redeem message that you'd like the streamer to play!
- If submit the redeem without inputting a value, I'll pick one for you.
- You may wish to ask the streamer what their limit settings are. Please be respectful towards the person playing the game.


## How To Use
- Place XephGBT.dll into your `Plugins` directory
- If you are a Supporter, configure your settings to get the most of the experience! See the next section.
- Run game, start stream, and have fun with your viewers!

## Setup Stream ChannelPoints and Limits
- Create new ChannelPoints redemptions for your stream account. If you're unsure how to do that visit Twitch's help page here
- Give each one a name. The defaults for the mod are "Invert Map", "Swap Colors", "Mirror Map", "Change JD", and "Change NJS" but feel free to change them to your liking.
- For the JD and NJS redemptions: *enable the enter a message option*. I suggest you write a message to ask your viewer to enter a number. If your viewer does not enter a number when they redeem, I'll pick a random value for them within the limits you've set.
- Open `XephGBT.json` located in your `BeatSaber\UserData` directory. Enter the **exact** names that you've given to your redemptions for their respective entries. Save and close.
- **Image here**
- For JD and NJS limits: You may set *any* integer or float. Yes, any.
- A side note: It is highly discouraged to touch the other fields in the file. Those are for Bloq Transformers to read and not intended for humans to touch. In the event you've perturbed them, delete the config file and restart the game :)

A lot of very hard work and countless hours went into the making of this mod. I hope you enjoy playing with it. Thank you

A warm note: This mod changes a player's game instantly. Please keep in mind when interacting with broadcasters that you're interacting with a real person. Please treat them with respect, in a way they would like to be treated. If you're unsure, they'll appreciate your asking :)
