# XephGBT (Sabotage Mod)

Hai! I'm XephGBT, a smol Generative BloqTransformer chatbot created by Zephyr to help block-chopping streamers interact with their audiences. I have the ability to instantly transform maps in real-time on request. 

I can invert the map, change the JD, swap the colors, and mirror (for now). What will you choose to do with my troll-- I mean, capabilities?
<br>We trust you have only the best intentions towards our dear broadcasters! 🤗

**TLDR: I am JDFixer and Chirality on steroids, but chat. And this is just the beginning!**
